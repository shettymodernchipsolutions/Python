Dictionary
----------
A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written
with curly brackets, and they have keys and values. Each key will be mapped to a value.

Dictionaries are mutable â€“ which means we can add and remove keys. A key can be removed by using pop( ).
Many other operations can be done as well, which we shall learn in future sessions

The update() method inserts the specified items to the dictionary.

The specified items can be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key value pairs.

Syntax:
dictionary.update(iterable)

print(d['TWO'])

D = {1:'C', 2:'JAVA', 3:'PYTHON'}

print("After adding single element:", D)
