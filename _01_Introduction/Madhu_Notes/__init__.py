Python was created by
Guido
van
Rossum
during
1985 - 1990.
Like
Perl, Python
source
code is also
available
under
the
GNU
General
Public
License(GPL).
Python is a
general - purpose
interpreted, interactive, object - oriented, and high - level
programming
language.
Python is designed
to
be
highly
readable.It
uses
English
keywords
frequently
where as other
languages
use
punctuation, and it
has
fewer
syntactical
constructions
than
other
languages.

void
main()
{
    Printf(“Hello
world”)
}

Class
Hello
{
    Public
static
void
main(*args)
{
    System.out.println(“Hello
world”);
}
}

print(“Hello
World”)


Features:

•    Python is Interpreted − Python is processed
at
runtime
by
the
Interpreter.You
do
not need
to
compile
your
program
before
executing
it.This is similar
to
PERL and PHP.
•    Python is Interactive − You
can
actually
sit
at
a
Python
prompt and interact
with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
•    Python is Object - Oriented − Python
supports
Object - Oriented
style or technique
of
programming
that
encapsulates
code
within
objects.
•    Python is a
Beginner
's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.

History
of
Python
Python
was
developed
by
Guido
van
Rossum in the
late
eighties and early
nineties
at
the
National
Research
Institute
for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.
Python is derived
from many other

languages, including
ABC, Modula - 3, C, C + +, Algol - 68, SmallTalk, and Unix
shell and other
scripting
languages
Python is now
maintained
by
a
core
development
team
at
the
institute, although
Guido
van
Rossum
still
holds
a
vital
role in directing
its
progress.
1.2
Features
of
Python:
•    Easy - to - learn − Python
has
few
keywords, simple
structure, and a
clearly
defined
syntax.This
allows
the
programmer
to
pick
up
the
language
quickly.
•    Easy - to - read − Python
code is more
clearly
defined and visible
to
the
eyes.
•    Easy - to - maintain − Python
's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
•    A
broad
standard
library − Python
's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.
•    Interactive
Mode − Python
has
support
for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
•    Portable − Python
can
run
on
a
wide
variety
of
hardware
platforms and has
the
same
interface
on
all
platforms.
•    Extendable − You
can
add
low - level
modules
to
the
Python
interpreter.These
modules
enable
programmers
to
add
to or customize
their
tools
to
be
more
efficient.
•    Databases − Python
provides
interfaces
to
all
major
commercial
databases.
•    GUI
Programming − Python
supports
GUI
applications
that
can
be
created and ported
to
many
system
calls, libraries and windows
systems, such as Windows
MFC, Macintosh, and the
X
Window
system
of
Unix.
•    Scalable − Python
provides
a
better
structure and support
for large programs than shell scripting.

Apart
from the above

-mentioned
features, Python
has
a
big
list
of
good
features, few
are
listed
below −
•    It
supports
functional and structured
programming
methods as well as OOP.
•    It
can
be
used as a
scripting
language or can
be
compiled
to
byte - code
for building large applications.
•    It
provides
very
high - level
dynamic
data
types and supports
dynamic
type
checking.Dynamically
typed
programming
language.
int
x = 10;  # C,C++,JAVA, others…
x = 10  # Python
•    It
supports
automatic
garbage
collection.
•    It
can
be
easily
integrated
with C, C + +, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.
1.3
Applications
for Python:  Web
application
Developer
Python is used in many
application
domains.Here
's a sampling.
The
Python
Package
Index
lists
thousands
of
third
party
modules
for Python.

i.Web and Internet
Development
Python
offers
many
choices
for web development:
    •    Frameworks
    such as Django and Pyramid.
•    Micro - frameworks
such as Flask and Bottle.Fast
API
•    Advanced
content
management
systems
such as Plone and django
CMS.

Python
's standard library supports many Internet protocols:

•    HTML and XML
•    JSON
•    E - mail
processing.
•    Support
for FTP, IMAP, and other Internet protocols.
•    Easy - to - use
socket
interface.
And
the
Package
Index
has
yet
more
libraries:

•    Requests, a
powerful
HTTP
client
library.
•    BeautifulSoup, an
HTML
parser
that
can
handle
all
sorts
of
oddball
HTML.
•    Feedparser
for parsing RSS / Atom feeds.
•    Paramiko, implementing
the
SSH2
protocol.

are
usable
on
several
platforms
are
available
separately:

Interpreter:

2.
Script
from the Command

-line:

4.
Integrated
Development
Environment:
You
can
run
Python
from a Graphical

User
Interface(GUI)
environment as well,
if you have a GUI application on your system that supports Python.
•    Unix − IDLE is the
very
first
Unix
IDE
for Python.
    •    Windows − PythonWin is the
    first
    Windows
    interface
    for Python and is an IDE with a GUI.
For
both
Windows, Linux
you
can
use
different
IDE’s
