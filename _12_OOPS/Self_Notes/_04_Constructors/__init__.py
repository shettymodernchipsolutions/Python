"""Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors is
to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the
class is created. In Python the _init_() method is called the constructor and is always
called when an object is created.
Syntax of constructor declaration :
def _init_(self):
# body of the constructor
Types of constructors :

default constructor: The default constructor is a simple constructor which doesnâ€™t
accept any arguments. Its definition has only one argument which is a reference to
the instance being constructed.

parameterized constructor: constructor with parameters is known as
parameterized constructor. The parameterized constructor takes its first argument
as a reference to the instance being constructed known as self and the rest of theparameterized constructor
"""
"""
Features of Python Constructors: 

In Python, a Constructor begins with double underscore () and is always named as __init_().
In python Constructors, arguments can also be passed.
In Python, every class must necessarily have a Constructor.
If there is a Python class without a Constructor, a default Constructor is automatically created without any arguments and parameters."""
"""
Counting the number of objects of a class
The constructor is called automatically when we create the object of the class. Consider the following example."""
