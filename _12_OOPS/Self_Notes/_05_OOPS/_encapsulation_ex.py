'''Encapsulation:
-----------------
Definition: Binding the data members & member methods into single entity.

entity: class /object
data members: Fields / Variables / Attributes(class ,instance variables)
member methods: Methods(Instance Methods, Class Methods, Static Methods)

satish = Employee(100, 'satish, 15000)

Class == = > Logical - - DATA Physical - - METHODS
Object == = > Physical - - DATA Logical - - METHODS(Through method access)

Ex:
class is an example for encapsulation

object is also an example

satish = Employee1(100, "satish", 15000)

"""
Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions that work on that data within a single object. By doing so, you can
hide the internal state of the object from the outside.This is known as information hiding.

A class is an example of encapsulation.A class bundles data and methods into a single unit.
And a class provides the access to its attributes via methods.

The idea of information hiding is that if you have an attribute that isn’t visible to the outside, you can control the
access to its value to make sure your object is always has a valid state.'''

Calling protected member of base class:
Private members:
Private members are similar to protected members, the difference is that the class members declared private should
neither be accessed outside the class nor by any base class.In Python, there is no existence of Private instance
variables that cannot be accessed except inside a class.However, to define a private member prefix the member name with
double underscore “__”.


Note: Python’s private and protected member can be accessed outside the class through python name mangling.
